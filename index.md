Hello! I'm Quaid Johar. I am a software developer, currently living in Daman, India. I have completed my B.E in Computer Science and I am presently working full time as a Python developer in a Mumbai-based company for the past 2.5 years.

In my free time, I am constantly experimenting with new technologies, frameworks and reading technical blogs to improve my skillset. AI, ML, and Blockchain are some of the subjects I am learning and curious about their applications.

I am very interested in watching how technology is changing our lives, I strive to better myself as a developer and the developer community as a whole.
